This is a generative art toy where the user can input their own formulas that will then be graphed in 3D.

The main purpose of this project was for me to understand typescript along with all the necessary tools a bit more.

This will probably be a project I will update from time to time if ideas come to mind as I found myself just writing cool looking graphs on my phone when waiting for things to compile at work.
